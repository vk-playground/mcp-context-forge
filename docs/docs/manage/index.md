!!! info "MariaDB & MySQL Fully Supported"
    MCP Gateway now has **complete MariaDB/MySQL support** alongside SQLite and PostgreSQL:

    - **36+ database tables** work perfectly with MariaDB 12.0+ and MySQL 8.4+
    - All **VARCHAR length issues** resolved for MariaDB/MySQL compatibility
    - Connection string: `DATABASE_URL=mysql+pymysql://mysql:changeme@localhost:3306/mcp`
    - See [Configuration Reference](configuration.md) for complete setup instructions

Update the file and restart the container or process to apply changes.

## 🧪 Health & Readiness

Expose the `/health` endpoint for use with:

- Cloud load balancer health checks
- Kubernetes probes
- CI/CD smoke tests

Sample check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:4444/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "status": "healthy"}
```
