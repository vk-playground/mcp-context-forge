## What is MCP Gateway?

**MCP Gateway** is an orchestration and federation layer for the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/modelcontext/protocol). It provides:

- A unified entrypoint for tools, resources, prompts, and agents
- Federation of multiple MCP servers into one composable catalog
- Protocol enforcement, health monitoring, and registry centralization
- A visual Admin UI to manage everything in real time

Whether you're integrating REST APIs, local functions, or full LLM agents, MCP Gateway standardizes access and transport — over HTTP, WebSockets, SSE, or stdio.
