## 🔗 Connecting to MCP Gateway

To integrate Continue with your MCP Gateway:

1. **Add MCP Server Configuration**:
   In your `~/.continue/config.json`, add the following under the `experimental` section:

   ```json
   {
     "experimental": {
       "modelContextProtocolServer": {
         "transport": {
           "type": "stdio",
           "command": "uvx",
           "args": ["mcpgateway-wrapper"]
         }
       }
     }
   }
```

Replace `"mcpgateway-wrapper"` with the appropriate command or path to your MCP Gateway server if different.

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   Ensure the following environment variables are set:

   * `MCP_GATEWAY_BASE_URL`: Base URL of your MCP Gateway (e.g., `http://localhost:4444`).
   * `MCP_SERVER_CATALOG_URLS`: URL(s) to the server catalog(s) (e.g., `http://localhost:4444/servers/2`).
   * `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: JWT token used for authentication (as generated by `python3 -m mcpgateway.utils.create_jwt_token`).

   You can set these in your system environment or within the Continue configuration if supported.

## 🧪 Using MCP Tools in Continue

Once configured:

* **Discover Tools**: Continue will automatically fetch and list available tools from the MCP Gateway.
* **Invoke Tools**: Use natural language prompts in Continue to invoke tools. For example:

  * "Run the `hello_world` tool with the argument `name: Alice`."
* **Monitor Responses**: Continue will display the tool's output directly within the chat interface.

## 📝 Tips for Effective Use

* **Custom Instructions**: Utilize Continue's Custom Instructions feature to tailor its behavior across all projects.
* **Model Selection**: Choose the AI model that best fits your project's needs within the Continue settings.
* **.continue/config.json**: Customize your Continue experience by editing this configuration file.
