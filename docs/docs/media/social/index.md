    !!! quote "Manav Gupta – Vice President & CTO, IBM Canada @ IBM | June 24, 2025"
        "I have been lucky to collaborate and contribute to mcp-context-forge. It serves as a central management point for tools, resources, and prompts that can be accessed by MCP-compatible LLM applications. Converts REST API endpoints to MCP, composes virtual MCP servers with added security and observability, and converts between protocols (stdio, SSE, Streamable HTTP). I think this will be way to build AI Agents of the future."

        "Armand Ruiz, IBM's VP of AI Platform, hails the open-source MCP Gateway as 'a great step forward for those building agentic systems, orchestrating tools, or deploying complex GenAI apps.' ... With MCP Gateway streamlining tool orchestration and ACP redefining agent interactions, IBM is pushing to standardize AI infrastructure. As Ruiz emphasizes, this dual approach reduces deployment friction, empowering developers to scale GenAI applications efficiently."
