"""MCP Gateway v0.7.0 Multitenancy Resource Fix

This script finds and fixes resources that lack proper team assignments
after the v0.6.0 → v0.7.0 multitenancy migration. This can happen if:
- Resources were created after the initial migration
- Migration was incomplete for some resources
- Database had edge cases not handled by the main migration

Fixes: servers, tools, resources, prompts, gateways, a2a_agents

Usage:
    python3 scripts/fix_multitenancy_0_7_0_resources.py
