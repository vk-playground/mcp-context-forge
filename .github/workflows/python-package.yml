    # Build the package under multiple Python versions to catch ABI issues early
    strategy:
      matrix:
        python-version: [ "3.10", "3.11", "3.12" ]  # Extend as needed

    steps:
      # 1️⃣  Check out repository so Makefile & sources are available
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4     # Standard checkout step

      # 2️⃣  Set up the requested Python version from the runner tool-cache
      - name: Set up Python ${{ matrix.python-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5  # Recommended approach for consistent PATH
        with:
          python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}

      # 3️⃣  Install build front-end; Keep pip current; bootstrap venv
      - name: Install build tool
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
          python3 -m pip install build   # PyPA-endorsed PEP 517 builder

      - name: Bootstrap project venv
        run: make venv

      # 4️⃣  Invoke the Makefile 'dist' target (creates ./dist/*.whl & *.tar.gz)
      - name: Build distributions
        run: make dist                 # Uses the Makefile's `dist` rule

      # 5️⃣  Install package quality tools
      - name: Install package linters
        run: |
          python3 -m pip install twine check-manifest pyroma

      # 6️⃣  Validate wheel/sdist metadata
      - name: Check distribution metadata (twine)
        run: twine check dist/*

      # 7️⃣  Verify MANIFEST.in completeness
      - name: Check manifest (check-manifest)
        run: check-manifest

      # 8️⃣  Assess package quality
      - name: Check package quality (pyroma)
        run: pyroma -d .

      # 9️⃣  Upload built artifacts so they can be downloaded from the run page
      - name: Upload distributions
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: python-package-${{ matrix.python-version }}
